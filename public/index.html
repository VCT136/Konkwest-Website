        <h2>Historical accuracy</h2>
        <p>
          In the development of Konkwest I have strived to achieve a high level of historical accuracy with the starting <a href="#scenarios">scenarios</a>. Since I am a Game Developer and not a researcher by trade however, I am fully aware that there will be errors in the game. Please let me know when you notice something wrong. Maybe I can fix it in a future update.
