      <h2>Cross-platform Multiplayer</h2>
      <p>
        The game features multiplayer gameplay where you can play together with, or against friends all over the world. <br>
        Multiplayer services are powered by <a href="https://www.photonengine.com/fusion" target="_blank">Photon Fusion</a>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="scenarios">
      <h2>4 Scenarios</h2>
      <p>
        You choose the setting! Each one comes with <a href="#historical-accuracy">historical / canonical</a> countries. Some scenarios also begin with industrialized places, some don't. You can also choose to play without a scenario, filling the world with custom countries only. <br>
        The <i>Kaiserzeit 1926</i> scenario is an alternate history scenario from a <a href="https://vct.one/projects/kaiserzeit1926/" target="_blank">board game</a> I made.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Contemporary</li>
        <li>1900</li>
        <li>1700</li>
        <li>Kaiserzeit 1926</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="places">
      <h2>&gt 1500 Places</h2>
      <p>
        Each place can be part of one region and country. Different languages can be spoken in a place, and they can have different terrain types and elevations, which influence the way countries interact with them. There are fields, forests, deserts, rainforests, grasslands and snow-covered places.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="custom-countries">
      <h2>Custom countries</h2>
      <p>
        You rule your country as you want! You can rename the country, its regions, and its places. You can change its color and adjust its policies to your liking. You can develop industry whereever you like and you choose what your country's next moves are. It's all in your control.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="historical-accuracy">
      <h2 id="historical-accuracy">Historical accuracy</h2>
      <p>
        In the development of Konkwest I have strived to achieve a high level of historical accuracy with the starting scenarios. Since I am a Game Developer and not a researcher by trade however, I am fully aware that there will be errors in the game. Please let me know when you notice something wrong. Maybe I can fix it in a future update.
